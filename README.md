# Anti-Duplicator

This script finds and shows files that have duplicates.

# Quickstart

To start, you must specify the path to the folder to be checked:

```bash
$ python3 duplicates.py /path/to/folder/
These files have duplicat-e/es:
['/home/xatt/Python/devman/dups/war.txt', '/home/xatt/Python/devman/dups/du/war.txt']
['/home/xatt/Python/devman/dups/pic.png', '/home/xatt/Python/devman/dups/du/pic.png', '/home/xatt/Python/devman/dups/du/dup/pic.png']
```
